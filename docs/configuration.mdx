# Configuration Overview

SmartPOSv7 uses SQLite databases to handle various configurations and settings for both the GUI application and the POS server. Below is an overview of the SQLite files and their purposes.

---

## GUI Application Settings

The GUI application stores its configuration in a dedicated SQLite database. This database contains the following tables:

### Tables:
1. **App Settings**: Stores general application settings such as theme, language, and user preferences.
2. **Machine Settings**: Contains machine-specific configurations like hardware identifiers and system preferences.
3. **Device Settings**: Manages connected device configurations, such as barcode scanners, printers, and cash drawers.
4. **Extended Settings**: Stores additional settings for advanced customization and integrations.

## POS Server Settings

The POS server uses a single SQLite database file named `ServerSetup.sqlite` to manage all server-related configurations.

### SQLite File:
- **ServerSetup.sqlite**: This file contains all the necessary configurations for the POS server.

### Tables:
1. **App Settings**: Stores server-specific application settings, such as server mode, logging preferences, and update configurations.
2. **Machine Settings**: Contains server machine-specific settings, including network configurations and hardware details.

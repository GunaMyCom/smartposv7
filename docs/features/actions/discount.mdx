  - **Tax** → Total tax amount for all items  
  - **Discount** → Total discount applied  
  - **Total Amount** → Final amount after tax and discount  
  - **Taxable Amount** → Amount before tax and discount  
  - **Balance Amount** → Remaining due after partial payment

Discounting supports both fixed promotions and flexible price adjustments while ensuring taxes are calculated correctly.

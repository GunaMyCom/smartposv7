# 🧾 Credit Customer

The **Credit Customer** feature allows you to record sales made on **credit**.  
Instead of collecting full payment immediately, you can assign the bill to a **customer’s account**, allowing them to **pay later**.

This is useful for:
- Trusted or regular customers  
- Corporate clients  
- Situations where immediate payment isn’t possible
